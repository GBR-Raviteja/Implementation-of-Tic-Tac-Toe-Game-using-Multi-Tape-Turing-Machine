# Implementation-of-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-Multi-Tape-Turing-Machine
This paper implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game using a Multi-Tape Turing Machine model. It demonstrates how automata theory and Turing Machines can be applied to game design, using multiple tapes to efficiently handle the gameâ€™s logic and simulate gameplay, with experiments run in JFLAP.
