# Implementation of Tic Tac Toe Game using Multi-Tape Turing Machine

This repository contains resources and summaries based on the IEEE publication for designing a Tic Tac Toe game with a Multi-Tape Turing Machine model.

## Abstract
Presents the implementation of a two-player Tic Tac Toe game using multi-tape Turing machine automata. Multiple tapes help efficiently encode the game board and moves, showcasing the power of theoretical computation in practical game design.

## Key Concepts
- Automata Theory and Turing Machine principles
- Multi-Tape Turing Machine for state management and game logic
- Application and simulation using JFLAP software

## Technologies & Methods
- Multi-Tape Turing Machine (MTTM) Model
- JFLAP for simulation and testing

## How to Use
1. Understand the basics of Turing machines and automata theory.
2. Model the Tic Tac Toe game states and rules for multi-tape operation.
3. Simulate and experiment with the game using JFLAP.
